# Specifies files to be ignored by Git for Android projects.
# This file helps keep your repository clean by excluding build artifacts,
# IDE-specific files, and other generated content that shouldn't be versioned.

### Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA ###
.idea/                  # IntelliJ IDEA project files (contains user-specific settings)
*.iml                   # IntelliJ IDEA module files
*.ipr                   # IntelliJ IDEA project file (older format)
*.iws                   # IntelliJ IDEA workspace file (older format)
captures/               # Performance monitor captures
.cxx/                   # NDK build output (e.g., CMake build intermediates)

### Gradle ###
.gradle/                # Gradle wrapper and other Gradle files (caches, etc.)
/build/                 # All compiled output, intermediate files, APKs, etc.
local.properties        # User-specific SDK paths and other local settings
*.log                   # Log files
*.apk                   # Compiled APKs
*.aab                   # Android App Bundles
*.aar                   # Android Archive (if generated locally)
/src/androidTest/assets/ # Assets generated during instrumentation tests

# Used by the Gradle build system to run annotation processors
.apt_generated/

### Keystore files ###
*.jks                   # Java Keystore files (CRITICAL to ignore production signing keys)
*.keystore              # Generic keystore files (CRITICAL to ignore production signing keys)
# debug.keystore          # Uncomment this line if you also want to ignore debug.keystore.
                        # It's generally harmless to commit debug.keystore as it's not for production.

### Native Development (NDK) ###
/obj/                   # Native object files
/libs/                  # Generated native libraries (e.g., .so files, if not committed explicitly)
*.so                    # Compiled shared libraries (if not committed explicitly)

### Miscellaneous ###
.DS_Store               # macOS specific file
Thumbs.db               # Windows specific file
ehthumbs.db             # Windows specific file
.directory              # Linux specific file (KDE)
*.orig                  # Files created by merge tools during conflicts
*.bak                   # Common backup file extension

# If you store sensitive information (like API keys) directly in a Gradle properties file,
# you might want to ignore specific local versions, but typically these should be
# handled via environment variables or a secure configuration management system.
# Example:
# secure.properties
